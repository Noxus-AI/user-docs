The `Condition` node is a logic module that can Filter values based on a specific condition or ask AI to filter it for you. This module is particularly useful, for example, when removing content from a list that fits a certain condition.

The `Condition` node has the following configurations:

- **AI Condition**: This allows you to use AI to separate elements that meet a given condition, or not. All you have to do is describe the condition that you want to be true, `E.g. value has at least two words.`
- **Condition**
  - Take into example the following condition:
  - <img height="120px" src="/images/ConditionExample.png" />
  - It reads like the following: If Input 1 contains the word 'Something', then return true. If not, return false.
- **When true return**
  - This is the output when the condition above is true
- **When false return**
  - This is the output when the condition above is false

The `Condition` module has **one input** and **two output**:

- **Input**: 
  - `Variable Inputs`, receives any number of inputs
- **Output**: 
  - `When true` gives the true condition
  - `When false` gives the false condition
