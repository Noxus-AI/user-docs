Description: "This trigger allows users to start a workflow from a given email received on Gmail."
---

A `Gmail trigger` interface allows users to run workflows seamlessly when an email is sent.

The `Gmail trigger` function has the following configs and inputs:

- **Source Email**: You might have multiple accounts connected with Noxus. If that's not the case, leave this field empty.
- **Label**: Specify the label and folder from which you want emails to be read from
- **Keyword**: Define a Keyword that, once mentioned in an email, will trigger the workflow
- **Inputs**: Define the input component of the email that should be passed onto the workflow

Take, for example, this trigger set to run everytime an email from INBOX has the keyword Billing.
