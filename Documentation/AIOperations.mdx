**AI Operations** are the core usage metric on the platform. Each action that uses AI counts toward your monthly usage, and the number of AI Operations you consume determines your billing.

#### **How it works**

- At the beginning of each **billing month**, your usage counter resets to **0**.
- Each account includes a **base amount of AI Operations** according to your plan.
- If you **exceed** your monthly allowance, additional AI Operations will be billed.
- These extra operations follow a **tiered pricing structure**
  - You can view the full breakdown of pricing directly in your **Billing page**.

#### **What counts as an AI Operation?**

The way AI Operations are counted depends on the type of action:

- **Workflow Run**
- **Workflow Lists**:
  - Each item processed in a list counts as **1 AI Operation**. _(For example, if a workflow separates into 20 items, it will count as 20 AI Operations)_
- **Chats**:
  - Every **10 sent messages** in a chat count as **1 AI Operation**.

#### **Where to track usage**

You can track your AI Operation usage and any additional charges in real time in your **Billing page** in your account settings.
