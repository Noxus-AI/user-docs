The `Read Webpage` module is a data module that can extract the text from a specific URL.

This module has multiple configurations that can enhance its capabilities.

- **Depth of sub-links**: The number of sub-links that will be read in each webpage. Note that the deeper, the more time it's going to take to run.
- **Scroll the Webpage**: When enabled, the model can smartly scroll the webpage to find more information. (Important for sites, that don't load completely and require the user to scroll)
- **Advanced Options**:
  - **Continue on Error**: If enabled, in case the scraping fails, the output value of Text will contain the value `<ERROR>`, instead of failing the workflow
  - **Parse HTML to Markdown**: If disabled, the output value of Text will contain the raw HTML, instead of the interpreted markdown version of the content

The `Read Webpage` module has **one input** and **two outputs**:

- **Input**:
  - `URL`, the link to the webpage you want to scrape. Anything more than the link will result in an error.
- **Output**: 
  - `Pages`, the text that was extracted from the webpage 
  - `Links Found`, a list with all the links found on each page. If you want to transform each sequence of links in a page into a list, you can use the module `Single value to list`
