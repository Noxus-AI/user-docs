## 1. What is it?

The workflow builder is one of the core tools in Noxus's platform. This is where you build, run, deploy, and share your AI workflows and tools.

To access the workflow builder, click "New Flow" on the page "My flows".

The workflow builder comprises the **Navigation Bar**, on the left, where you can find all the nodes to build your workflow - and the **Top Bar** - where you can Run and see past runs of your workflow.

## 2. Navigation Bar

The Navigation Bar is the library of modules aggregated by key functionality. Each module in the workflow builder is documented with a detailed explanation of their behavior.

- **Data Modules** üóÇÔ∏è: These modules allow you to transform and import data of multiple types and sources
- **Logic Modules** üß©: These modules are designed to help you build more complex workflows by combining text from different nodes, extracting specific information, or running things in parallel
- **AI Modules** ‚ú®: Includes state-of-the-art text, image and audio AI models
- **Integration Modules** üîó: Including integrations with tools such as Gmail, Google Drive, Google Sheets, Google Docs, Airtable, Notion, Confluence, and others
- **Sub Flows** üõ†Ô∏è: Use other Flows you have as a node. Great to simplify big workflows!

## 3. Builder canvas

The builder canvas is where you can let your creativity flourish and build automation that makes your life 10x more efficient and productive.

You can connect modules with the same data types together. Just take this very basic example:

You can then take things further to build more advanced workflows that perform much better than traditional agents and models.

Take, for example, this more complex workflow that uses two different agents both, search a company's Linkedin profile, and also find all their relevant information online:

## 4. Run

The Run page allows you to test your workflow and understand if it outputs the expected actions or results. Just fill the information on the left if necessary, press run, and see your nodes working their magic.

And that's it!

After building your workflow, consider using Triggers, that start your workflow automatically.
