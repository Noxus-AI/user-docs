The `Web Research`node dives deep into the web to find detailed info on topics youâ€™re interested about and gives you a neat summary.

The `Web research` module has **variable inputs** and **one output**:

- **Inputs**:
  - The node can receive any number of inputs that can be used the query
- **Output**:
  - The Summary or report from your query

This node has multiple configurations:

- `Query`, is the text you will send to the LLM. Remember to include the chips with the inputs that come to this node.
- `Depth,`choose between a shallow, more fast option, or a deep, more slow but more informed option
- `Number of searches,`how many searches the researcher looks into
- `Search location `-  Depending on where you are, search results are usually skewed to that region. As such, we allow you to choose where you want the researcher to be based at.
- `Include references`, allows the researcher to leave references through the report of where it got that information
- `Time Awareness`, the node will automatically convert mentions of time periods (e.g., 'next week', 'next month') into specific dates
- `Continue on Error` - If enabled, in case the researcher fails, the output value of Text will contain the value \<ERROR\>, instead of failing the workflow
