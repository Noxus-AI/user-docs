The `Generate Text` module can use any of the state-of-the-art AI models to generate text.

**You can use this module to perform intelligent tasks in your workflow**

The `Generate Text` module has **variable inputs** and **one output**:

- **Inputs**: The module can receive any number of inputs that can be used to create a `Prompt`, The `Prompt` contains the instruction for the AI model. For example, a `Prompt` can be: “Classify these AI models according to pricing criteria and performance,” along with the list of AI models to classify.
- **Output**: `Response`, The `Response` returns the output from the AI model based on the `Context` and `Prompt` inputs provided.
- **Configs**:
  - `Prompt`, is the text you will send to the LLM. Remember to include the chips with the inputs that come to this node.
    - On the bottom right corner of the Prompt textbox, you have our **Prompt improver**. Describe how you want to improve your prompt, and it will be enchanced. This increases clarity, precision and in the end, the effectivess of your final prompt.
  - `Context`, The `Context` describes the behavioral information in detail. You can reference the profession, personality traits, or behaviors you expect. For example, “you are an AI expert.” or "Always write in a professional way"
  - `Read Image URL's,`allows you to input links, and it will automatically analyse it if it is an image, taking all the necessary information.
  - `Smart model selection`, allows you to select which models you want to use. Either choose a preset of models we have arranged to focus on one of 3 categories - Performative, cost and length - Or, choose your own models.
