The AI-powered classification module automatically sorts text into your predefined categories, ensuring your content is organized efficiently.

In the configuration of the node you have:

- **Categories**, which have: 
  - **Category**
    - Insert here a name for the category
  - **Description**
    - Describe what this category is, and how to categorize it like it. This is the most important part.

As an example of this pair, you could have: Category - Marketing, Description - Anything regarding marketing materials.

The `Categorizer` module has **one input** and **two outputs**:

- **Input**: 
  - One input of type `Text`
- **Output**: 
  - `Category`, The selected category determined by the node.
  - `Reasoning` - The rationale behind the nodeâ€™s decision to choose that category.
