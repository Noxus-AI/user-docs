The `Smart Route` node is an intelligent decision-making module in your workflow. Simply provide the relevant information, define the routes and their conditions, and it will determine the optimal path for your flow.

This node has a configuration called routes. They are composed of:
  - **Action** 
    - This is the name of the Route taken. Eg. Urgent
  - **Condition**
    - This is the condition that describes when to take this route. Eg. Message contains urgent requests
  - **Output**
    - Format the output to your liking.


The `Smart Route` module has **variable inputs** and **variable outputs**:

- **Inputs**: 
  - The node can receive any number of inputs that can be used for the conditions and the outputs
- **Output**: 
  - The node can have multiple outputs, which are going to be each route the user has inserted above

As an example, we have a smart router that in one instance, sends an email immediately, and on the other case, it just outputs it.
