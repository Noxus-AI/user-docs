The `Interpret Image` module leverages advanced Vision-enabled Language Models to interpret images and provide answers to user-submitted questions. Connect an image and a prompt containing your question, and the model will analyze the visual content to deliver accurate responses.

**You can use this module to identify objects, understand contexts, or extract specific details; it offers a powerful way to interact with and gain insights from any image.**

The `Interpret Image` module has **two inputs** and **one output**:

- **Input**: `Prompt` and `Image`, a prompt containing any specific question or insight you want to take from the image.
- **Output**: `Text`, returns an answer to the request specified in the prompt.
- **Configs**:
  - `Context`, is a description on how you want the model to behave. Also known as system prompt.
  - `Smart model selection`  - Choose which type of models do you want from our preset ones, or choose your own.
