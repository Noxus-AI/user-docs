The `Find Documents` module has **one input** and **two outputs**:

- **Inputs**:
  - `Request`, which is the query for the documents you are looking for
- **Output**: 
  - `Documents`, This comes as a list, and it retrives all documents it found. The output comes in a file format, so, to output it, change the output type to `file`
  - `Report` is the answer to the request that was made, based on the documents it found
