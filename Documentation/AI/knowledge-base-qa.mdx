The `Knowledge Q&A` module quickly learns from sources like Google Drive files, PDFs, providing fast answers by extracting spcific information from complex documents.

In the configuration of the node you have:

- **Knowledge base**: 
  - Pick a knowledge base you have already created or create one
  - Upload documents directly here. With a maximum number of 20 files. For more, create a Knowledge base
  
This is one of the most poweful nodes in Noxus. Upload hundreds of documents to your Knowledge base, and see how quickly Noxus finds the answers to your questions.
