Merges different execution paths after a conditional node and uutputs the first complete value that it receives.

The `Join Paths` module has **variable inputs** and **one output**:

- **Input**: Can receive multiple inputs of type `text`;
- **Output**: is the first value from the inputs that has an actual value and is not empty.

Picture the image below, where after a conditional you have 2 paths, and then you merge them together to continue the flow.
