The `Extract fields` module is a logic module that can extract important information from a text block. This module is particularly useful when extracting key variables from a text to store in a spreadsheet or database.

**You can use this module to parse a complex output and extract relevant information for the workflow**

This module has multiple configurations:

- **Outputs**
  - Each output is one thing you want to take from the input and each one has
    - **Field** - This is the name of the output for you to see in the workflow
    - **Description** - **This is where you should explain what you want.** 
    - Eg. Let's say you want to find the date of when a document was emmited. In `Field` you write "Date", and in the `Description` you put "Date of emission"
- **Extracts as list**
  - Enabling will extract values in a list
- **Extract first only**
  - Enable if you want the module to only retrieve the first found value

The `Extract Information` module has **one input** and **variable outputs**:

- **Input**: 
  - `Text`, receives any text input
- **Output**: 
  - `Text`, can have unlimited text outputs; each output requires a proper description as those are leveraged by the AI agent to find the right information.

In this module, you can also use `Advanced Options` to select the AI model you want to use.

In the image below, the input is a file, which is tranformed to text in the File to Text node, and afterwards, we take the Date (Description: Date of emission) and Company (Description: Company responsible for the document) from the text.
