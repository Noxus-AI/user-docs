> **This Module requires that you connect your account. You can do this in the configuration of the node, or in the Integrations page**

The `Gmail - Send Email` module allows you to send an email from your Gmail address.

**This is particularly useful when you want to automate email outreach or receive / send reports (e.g., News reports / Competitor reports / Operational reports).**

The configurations of the node are:
- **Smart Formatting**
  - If enabled, the email is styled according to the content. Recommended for tables, reports and newsletters.
- **Draft**
  - If this is disabled, emails will be sent automatically. If not, they will be saved on your draft folder. We reccomend enabling this if you want to review your emails.

The `Gmail - Send Email` module has **four inputs**:

- **Input**: 
  - `Recipient` - The email you want to send an email to
  - `Title` - The title of the email. (Consider using a generate text to produce this)
  - `Body` - The actual body of the email
  - `Attachments` - Attachments to go with your email. They have to be in File form. (Consider using the text to file node) 

Important to note that the emails can take up to 2-3 minutes to be processed and sent.
