The `Outlook - Send Email` module allows you to send emails from your Outlook address with two powerful send modes: **Individual** and **Broadcast**.

**This is particularly useful when you want to automate email outreach, send personalized communications, or broadcast announcements (e.g., News reports / Competitor reports / Operational reports).**

## Send Modes

The module supports two distinct send modes, each with specific requirements:

### Individual Mode

Send personalized emails to multiple recipients with unique content for each.

**Requirements:**

- Recipients, titles, and bodies must have **equal lengths**
- If using attachments, they must also match the recipient count
- Minimum: 1 recipient

**Example Use Cases:**

- Personalized newsletters with recipient-specific content
- Custom reports for different departments
- Individual notifications with unique details

**Real Example:**

```
Recipients: ["john@company.com", "sarah@company.com", "mike@company.com"]
Titles: ["Your Q4 Sales Report", "Your Q4 Marketing Report", "Your Q4 Operations Report"]
Bodies: ["John, here's your sales data...", "Sarah, here's your marketing metrics...", "Mike, here's your operations summary..."]
Attachments: [sales_report.pdf, marketing_report.pdf, operations_report.pdf] (optional)
```

### Broadcast Mode

Send the same email content to multiple recipients simultaneously.

**Requirements:**

- Multiple recipients (2 or more)
- Single title and single body
- Single attachment or no attachment

**Example Use Cases:**

- Company-wide announcements
- Mass communications to customers
- Newsletter broadcasts with identical content

**Real Example:**

```
Recipients: ["team@company.com", "sales@company.com", "marketing@company.com", "support@company.com"]
Title: "Important: System Maintenance Scheduled"
Body: "Dear Team, We will be performing system maintenance on Friday..."
Attachments: maintenance_schedule.pdf (optional, single file only)
```

## Configuration Options

The configurations of the node are:

- **Send Mode**
  - Choose between "Individual" or "Broadcast" mode based on your email strategy
- **Smart Formatting**
  - If enabled, the email is styled according to the content. Recommended for tables, reports and newsletters.
- **Draft**
  - If this is disabled, emails will be sent automatically. If not, they will be saved in your draft folder. We recommend enabling this if you want to review your emails.

## Inputs

The `Outlook - Send Email` module has **four inputs**:

- **Recipients** - The email addresses you want to send emails to (array format)
- **Title** - The title(s) of the email (Consider using a generate text to produce this)
- **Body** - The actual body content of the email(s)
- **Attachments** - Attachments to go with your email. They have to be in File form. (Consider using the text to file node)

## Common Error Prevention

**Individual Mode Errors:**

- ❌ 3 recipients, 2 titles, 3 bodies → **Error: Unequal lengths**
- ✅ 3 recipients, 3 titles, 3 bodies → **Success**

**Broadcast Mode Errors:**

- ❌ 1 recipient → **Error: Broadcast requires multiple recipients**
- ❌ 3 recipients, 2 titles → **Error: Broadcast requires single title**
- ✅ 3 recipients, 1 title, 1 body → **Success**

Important to note that the emails can take up to 2-3 minutes to be processed and sent.
