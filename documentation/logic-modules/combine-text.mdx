Combine the text of the multiple source inputs as you like.

The `Combine Text` module has **variable inputs** and **one output**:

- **Input**: Can receive multiple inputs of type `text`; these can be used as a dynamic input inside the prompt of the Combine Text module.
- **Output**: `text`, the output is the prompt combined with the dynamic inputs.

The inputs will be available as chips on top of the text configuration. Don't forget to add them!
