The `Scorer` is a node that can evaluate text, and according to your specified criteria, retrieves a score.

In the configuration of the node you have:

- **Scoring Range**: 
  - Choose between a score range of 1-5 and 1-10
- **Score is minimum if**: 
  - Specify here what would represent the lowest value of 1
- **Score is maximum if**: 
  - Specify here what would represent the highest value of the range

The `Scorer` module has **one input** and **two outputs**:

- **Input**: 
  - One input of type `Text`
- **Output**: 
  - `Score`, The output is a number from the range given above
  - `Reasoning` is the rationale that the node took to achieve that number

Take into example a CV analyser that according to specified criteria gives a score to that CV for pre-screening
