The **Make API Request** module allows you to interact with any external API directly within your workflow. Whether you’re retrieving data from a REST API, sending information to a third-party service, or integrating with custom backends, this node gives you flexible control over how requests are made and how responses are handled.

You can use this module to bring external, real-time data into your workflow or trigger external services as part of a broader automation.

This module has multiple configurations that define how the request is made and what kind of input it receives.

#### **Configuration Options**

- **No Inputs**:
  - Toggle this setting on if you are planning on not passing any inputs to this node. 
- **URL**:
  - The endpoint to which the request should be sent. You can use a fixed value or reference a variable if inputs are enabled.
- **Body**:
  - Optional. If you’re making a request type that requires a body (such as POST, PUT, or PATCH), you can define the payload here. The body should be formatted as a string, typically in JSON.

**Advanced Options**

- **Headers**:

  Define custom request headers, such as authorization tokens, content types, or other metadata required by the API.

#### **Inputs**

- **(Variable number of inputs depending on configuration)**

  When **Use Inputs** is enabled, the node accepts one or more dynamic inputs such as URL, Body, or Header values.

#### **Outputs**

- **Response**:
  - The body of the response returned by the API, typically in text or JSON format.
- **Status Code**
  - The HTTP status code from the API response (e.g., 200, 404, 500).
- **Headers**
  - The headers returned by the API in the response.
