## Conversing with Assistants

Interacting with assistants through the API follows a structured flow that enables natural, contextual conversations. Understanding this flow helps you build effective assistant integrations.

### Conversation Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Conversation">
    Start by creating a new conversation with the assistant using the [Create Conversation](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-create-conversation) endpoint.
    
    This establishes a conversation context that will maintain history and state throughout the interaction.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send User Message">
    Add the user's initial message to the conversation using the [Add Message](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-add-message) endpoint.
    
    The message should contain a clear request or question to get the most helpful response.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive Assistant Response">
    The assistant processes the message and generates a response, which is automatically added to the conversation.
    
    Retrieve the updated conversation with the [Get Conversation](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-get-conversation) endpoint to see the assistant's response.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Continue the Conversation">
    Add follow-up messages using the [Add Message](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-add-message) endpoint.
    
    The assistant maintains context from previous messages, enabling natural back-and-forth dialogue.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Conversations

Effective conversation management involves several key operations:

- **Listing Conversations**: View all conversations using the [List Conversations](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-list-conversations) endpoint
- **Retrieving History**: Get complete conversation history with the [Get Conversation](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-get-conversation) endpoint
- **Refreshing Responses**: Generate updated responses to previous messages with the [Refresh Message](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-refresh-message) endpoint
- **Ending Conversations**: Remove conversations when no longer needed using the [Delete Conversation](/api-reference/v1/conversations/public-delete-conversation) endpoint

<Warning>
  Rate limits may apply to conversation API endpoints. Implement appropriate retry logic and respect rate limit headers in responses.
</Warning>

## Available Tools

Assistants can be equipped with specialized tools that extend their capabilities beyond basic conversation. Each tool enables specific functionality that can be activated during conversations.

### Configuration Best Practices

For optimal assistant performance:

- **Focused Tool Selection**: Only enable tools that are relevant to the assistant's purpose
- **Clear Instructions**: Provide detailed custom instructions for both the assistant and individual tools
- **Appropriate Temperature**: Use lower temperature (0.1-0.3) for factual assistants and higher (0.4-0.7) for creative ones
- **Knowledge Base Alignment**: Connect Knowledge Bases that contain information relevant to the assistant's domain
- **Regular Updates**: Review and update assistant configurations as your needs evolve

<Warning>
  Enabling too many tools can make an assistant less focused. Consider creating multiple specialized assistants rather than a single assistant with all possible tools.
