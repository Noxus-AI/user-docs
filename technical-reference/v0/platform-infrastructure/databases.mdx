# Postgres

## Knowledge Bases - Pgvector

We use [Pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) to store the embeddings for the knowledge bases, as well as other attributes in the databases that benefit from semantic searching, i.e. searching on past runs.
Pgvector is a PostgreSQL extension that provides support for vector data types and operations. It allows you to store and query vector embeddings efficiently.
Furthermore, it is a widely supported extension on cloud providers.
