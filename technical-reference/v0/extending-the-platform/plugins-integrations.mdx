# Adding an integration

Integrations are the building blocks behind interacting with external services. They allow users to add API keys or configure oauth2.0 flows to external services.

Imagine you are trying to interact with openweathermap.org in one of your nodes. You would have to add an integration to your node, and configure it with your API key.

Let's start by adding a way for the user to define their API key:

```python
from noxus.integrations import (
    register_integration,
    Integration,
    AuthType,
    OauthConfig,
    NestedOauthConfig,
    register_custom_integration,
    disconnect_custom_integration,
    has_custom_integration,
)

async def complete_integration(db: AsyncSession, group: UserGroup, request: Request):
    data = await request.json()
    return await register_custom_integration(
        db,
        group,
        "openweathermap",
        {
            "api_key": data["api_key"],
        },
    )


OpenWeatherMapIntegration = Integration(
    name="OpenWeatherMap",
    authorized=True,
    image="/api/backend/logo/example.com",
    integration=OauthConfig(
        type=AuthType.apikey,
        config=NestedOauthConfig(
            width=660,
            height=660,
            name="OpenWeatherMap",
            delete=f"/groups/group_id/integrations/custom/openweathermap/disconnect",
            trigger=f"/groups/group_id/integrations/custom/openweathermap",
        ),
    ),
    get_status=lambda db, group: has_custom_integration(db, group, "openweathermap"),
    complete_integration=complete_integration,
    delete_integration=lambda db, group, _: disconnect_custom_integration(
        db, group, "openweathermap"
    ),
)
```

Then you return the integration in the `integrations` method of your plugin.

If we now wanted to use the integration in a node, we would have to define a node class that would fetch the integration value:

```python
from noxus.nodes import ExecutionContext, BaseNode

class OpenWeatherMapNode(BaseNode[OpenWeatherMapNodeConfig])
    ...
    # adding this tells the frontend that the integration must be configured to use the node
    integrations = ["openweathermap"]

    def call(self, ctx: ExecutionContext, ...):
        api_key = (await ctx.custom_integration("openweathermap"))["api_key"]
        ...
```
